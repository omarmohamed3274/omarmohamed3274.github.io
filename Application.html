	<h3>Artificial Intelligence Applications: Marketing</h3>
	<p>Marketing is a way to sugar coat your products to attract more customers. We, humans, are pretty good at sugar coating, but what if an algorithm or a bot is there solely for the purpose of marketing a brand or a company? It would do a pretty awesome job!

In the early 2000s, if we searched an online store to find a product without knowing it’s exact name, it would become a nightmare to find the product. But now when we search for an item on any e-commerce store, we get all possible results related to the item. It’s like these search engines are reading our minds! In a matter of seconds, we get a list of all relevant items. An example of this is finding the right movies on Netflix.</p>

		<h3>Artificial Intelligence Applications: Banking</h3>
	<p>AI in banking is growing faster than you thought! A lot of banks have already adopted AI-based systems to provide customer support, detect anomalies and credit card frauds. An example of this is HDFC Bank.

HDFC Bank has developed an AI-based chatbot called EVA (Electronic Virtual Assistant), built by Bengaluru-based Senseforth AI Research.

Since its launch, Eva has addressed over 3 million customer queries, interacted with over half a million unique users, and held over a million conversations. Eva can collect knowledge from thousands of sources and provide simple answers in less than 0.4 seconds.</p>

			<h3>Artificial Intelligence Applications: Finance</h3>
	<p>Ventures have been relying on computers and data scientists to determine future patterns in the market. Trading mainly depends on the ability to predict the future accurately.

Machines are great at this because they can crunch a huge amount of data in a short span. Machines can also learn to observe patterns in past data and predict how these patterns might repeat in the future.

In the age of ultra-high-frequency trading, financial organizations are turning to AI to improve their stock trading performance and boost profit.</p>
